The staff member I talked to was really friendly and helped me when I told her I had never been there before and wasn't sure about portions and what not.  I settled on the bulgogi burrito, chicken tostada, and pork belly taco since it was a special that week.\\n\\nThe chicken tostada was AMAZING.  It was so good.  I love that the tostada is actually made out of rice and it has this deliciously crunchy sear on the outside of the rice patty.  I'm definitely hooked on that.

Against the advice of the waitstaff I ordered the IPA.\\n   I got a glass of beer, took a few sips and realized that it was not an IPA, craft beer or any type of non-commercial beer.  It wasn't a bad IPA, or a weak IPA, it simply was not an IPA, and not what I had ordered.  After being  ignored for a few minutes I flagged down the waitress.  I asked if I had gotten the IPA, she said yes.  I was friendly and told her perhaps the drought lines where switched.  She said that the lines where not switched and that everybody complains about that beer, which is why she told me not to order it.  I asked she could give me a Bass instead, she said no.  I was very confused and told her that this was not the right beer and that it tasted like Miller Lite.  The server got very defensive and told me that it definitely was not Miller Lite.  The server left, and after taking a sip or two of my beer (which was not what I had order)  I left and went to my gate. \\n  20 minutes later one of the servers came to my gate and told me that I had left without paying.  I told her that I had hoped to do so!

Serving up a beer on a tap that is not what it says it is wrong (and probably against some type of law).  The fact that they took the time to find me at my gate over 1/4 of a beer blows my mind.

I am now on a gluten-free diet and have other allergies so, suffice it to say, I don't get to eat Italian often. However I was told that they have gluten-free pasta and other choices. I was initially impressed by the sheet that breaks down their meals by allergen so that one knows what is safe. Kudos on that. This is more than most places provide.\\n\\nHowever, they have Basil Pesto Sauce listed as NOT being gluten-free nor soy free. Finding that odd, I asked the waiter to confirm with the chef, and I was told there was no wheat product at all in the pesto, which seems correct. (I did not ask about the soy, but I would wager that sneaks in somehow thanks to the cheese.)\\n\\nSo I ordered the Create Your Own Pasta of gluten-free penne with pesto sauce, shrimp, peppers, spinach, and mushrooms.\\n\\nWhen my bowl of pasta arrived, it had all of the above. However, it also had onions, zucchini, and eggplant, yet I had to dig to find a shrimp. I originally assumed I had somebody else's order.\\n\\nThe waiter, who was wonderful and attentive, took the bowl away and offered to replace it as I ordered. I would have eaten the original bowl, and told him so, but I was more concerned, as I said, that it was someone else's.\\n\\nAs a side note, if these flourishes of extra vegetables are an example of a cook's flair, I would say that if a customer orders a straight menu item, that might be acceptable. But when I fill out a cute little checkbox form with what I want on my Create Your Own Pasta bowl, I *only* want the items I checked off.\\n\\nA fresh bowl arrived later exactly as ordered. Except the pasta was undercooked. I don't mean really firm al-dente. I mean some were still way under done. Now, I know that gluten-free pasta takes longer to cook, and they probably rushed the bowl to get it to me. But that bowl was almost inedible.\\n\\nThe waiter did offer to get me a third bowl. I declined and soldiered through it. We were having dinner out for my wife's birthday and I did not want to belabor the meal. The waiter then offered us dessert to make up for the problems. Though I did agree to this, and I'm not demanding or even asking for a full dinner cost to be covered, it seems inadequate for management to offer me a three dollar dessert to make up for a twice-failed $14 dinner.

I have to give props to the staff for keeping things as clean as they do. \\n\\nThe auditoriums are large and spacious. Each auditorium has reclining seats which are really nice especially for people who might need the extra comfort while watching a long film.\\n\\nMy mom and I were really impressed by the prices at the snack counter. Up at the Flagstaff Harkins Theatres, movie snacks can cost you an arm and a leg. I feel that the price of snacks at Cinemark 16 is extremely reasonable by comparison.\\n\\nOne nice thing about Cinemark 16 is that you can order tickets online in advance and reserve seats in the auditoriums. This is really convenient, especially if you are trying to view a popular movie like Star Wars. You can also earn point by ordering online or through the app which can be put towards earning food or even a ticket to a movie. \\n\\nIt takes a while to earn the points though and I'm not sure whether or not they expire if they aren't used in enough time. But it is still a nice perk that the theater offers.\\n\\nOne downside is that they often only have their specialty movies (like foreign films or Studio Ghibli movies for example) offered during lunch time when the ticket prices are higher so you always end up paying more for them. That being said, the prices are still very reasonable when compared to other theaters that offer similar showings of select, 3D, foreign, or other specialty films.\\n\\nIf you are in the Mesa area and are looking for a good place to see a movie, I definitely recommend checking out Cinemark 16. It's one of the best theaters in the Valley that we have found.\",\n",

Let me go over as to why: \\n\\nFood: we shared an order of chow mein, beef noodle soup, and beef cakes. Very flavorful to say the least. When you're there, I highly subject to order soup since this is their highlighting meals. Regardless, I don't really think you can go wrong with any of the dishes. \\n\\nService: The noodles are handmade as you see attendants stretching the and kneading the dough. That was one of the most memorable parts of the visit and I love how transparent they are about cooking your food. You know you're eating quality dishes to the highest standard. Also the waiters were on point about their service. I love how friendly they were and always asked if we need anything else. The food was also quick to deliver with only the beef cakes that experienced a bit of a hiccup. \\n\\nAmbiance: beautiful and modern. It's modest in size but very intimate for dinner with friends. Its brightly lit with adorable sets of utensils along with them. Every elements in the restaurant flowed with the design from the colors of the wall to the soup spoons. \\n\\nPrices: amazing. It really shows that good food doesn't have to be expensive. And to be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if they bumped up the prices just a tad bit more but the fact that they keep their prices low with large portions is admirable. They're definitely consumer-friendly in all aspects. \\n\\nA must try when you're in the area! Oh and after your meal, save room for dessert which is found right next door!\",\n",

Located near Queen and Roncesvalles, Bar Salumi is the kid sister of Local Kitchen (which is right next door). It's a wee space that's lousy for groups but perfect for a date; narrow, dim, and buzzing with noise. The kitchen is simply everything you can see behind the bar, a space no wider than a hula hoop. Food is an integral part of the decor: a couple of shiny manual meat slicers are perched on the bartop and massive hunks of cured meat dangle from the ceiling. You can watch the cooks prepare everything (which I did avidly), and it just makes you that much hungrier. \\n\\nStrong drinks are key while watching food prep. As long as you like negronis, the cocktail list is decent. They have a few variations of the classic cocktail (one with prosecco, another with soda, etc). I opted for a variation swapping out vermouth for a berry-tea-infused Cointreau. Amidst all the flavours, I can't honestly say I could pick out the berry tea, but I liked it. My date choose a simple aperol sour and it was -- as the ladies sometimes say -- uh-mazing.\\n\\nA tiny space means a tiny menu. There are a smattering of simple appetizers like sardines and crostini, an olive plate, grilled octopus, and other nibbles. We elected to share grilled pears and soft cheese, served on proscuitto and drizzled with pine nuts and honey. I loved this. A great way to get your appetite going. \\n\\nThere are even fewer pizza options than apps. Of the four, we went with bison with buffalo mozzarella, thyme and lemon. The square pizza is a decent portion, so with an appetizer it was just enough for the two of us[1]. Was the pizza good? HOT DAMN. It was dotted with savoury bison meatballs and served with a fresh lemon wedge on top. The crust was brilliantly thin and so buttery and rich, I should have reached out and high-fived the chef. (I just thanked him instead.) Such a perfect balance of flavours, with not one ingredient overpowering another. I wholeheartedly agree with Ashleigh G when she says that this place could give the other pizza powers in the city a run for their money.\\n\\nThere is no dessert menu at present, but the chef told me that they might be coming up with something soon. Exciting. If this place is a secret, it won't be for long. Five stars all the way.\\n\\nObligatory Title Anagram: I MAUL BARS.\\n\\nMenu Readability: A5-sized paper on a clipboard.

They were extremely nice at first, but after I signed my lease they never would return my calls when I had something that needed to be checked out in my apartment. I lived in a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom, unit on the second floor. When it would rain the wall in my master bed room would fill up with water. I told them about it numerous times but all they finally did was fix the roof, instead of actually replacing the drywall. I mean hello? Mold, or mildew did not seem to concern them in the slightest.\\n\\nAnother time my washer stopped working and when the maintenance man came to fix it I noticed that there was dirt and a few cigarette butts under the washer. He took apart the top section of the washer and it was extremely filthy as well. \\n\\nAnother time I wanted to help my friend throw a small party at the pool for her 4 year old son, so called the office to make sure it would be ok. They never called me back after I called twice. Imagine that right?\\n\\nAlso, the workout room was open 24 hours but I would get creeped out because the 2 guys that lived next to the gym would watch all the girls working out from their balcony. They seriously need to invest in some shades.\\n\\nAnother time my husband and I went outside to go bike riding and guess what we encountered? The SWAT team! They were positioned all over the apartment complex, hiding under stairways. There was also another incident where this crazy girl took a baseball bat to someones car. \\n\\nAnother time when I was out of town and returned home, I noticed that my living room door had been left unlocked by someone.

I was put on hold while the girl in the office called matience to ask them about it. They denied it of course.\\n\\nThen when I moved out they kept my deposit of around $200 and tried to charge me and additional $100! I went into the office to ask why they were charging me the amount. There was a young girl behind the desk when I first went into the office, so we sat down and I asked her to brake down the charges for me. She said $100 was for the carpet, other things were the ceiling fan, bent shades, etc. Then again she pointed to another charge and said it was for the carpet. I called her out on repeating two different times where they charged me for the carpet and she seemed to act confused.She didn\\'t really know what she was doing, but she was at least trying to help.\\n     I asked to speak to her manager and she went into an office where the manager made up something for the girl to tell me that she was too busy and they would call me back.

I explained to her that I was being overcharged and she said \"My definition of clean and yours are obviously different.\" REALLY lady?? So I asked for her managers phone number. She gave me a number for an Ashley Dunham who I sent the pics to. They ended up cutting the bill in half and I had to pay $50. So they kept my deposit and charged me the $50 on top of it.

However my experience left me feeling like I wouldn\\'t go there if you paid me. \\n\\nI arrived to my appointment on time, but since it was my first visit there and the GPS  leads you to a giant office complex. I took a few minutes going in circles to locate the actual building and suite number. Once I did, it was extremely crowded and took several more minutes to find parking. I walked inside the office to a line of seven people in queue waiting to see the receptionist. When it was finally my turn to see the receptionist it was now about 13 minutes after my appointment time and she told me they would need to reschedule me because it was more than 10 minutes late. I obviously was shocked and advised her I took the day off and wouldn\\'t mind waiting as long as I needed to, but really couldn\\'t take another day off. They referred me to the head nurse who robotically kept repeating I was 10 minutes late and would need to reschedule. I explained that I was new to the area and could not locate the actual building. That coupled with my having to drive in circles looking for parking in a fully packed lot led me to be the 12 minutes late. In addition by the time I saw the receptionist at the front after waiting in queue, it was another six minutes or so.\\n\\nThe office nurse said the doctor would not \"stay late just for me\" and I was confused as to how he would be staying late if he probably took another patient in my place since the room had at least 30 people waiting and I was willing to wait as long as need be. Again I reiterated, it was only a total of 15 minutes and it\\'s not like this was a chronic problem or that I casually walked in. It was my first time there being a new patient and instead of being given the benefit of the doubt, they instead tried to embarrass me front of the whole office like I was a criminal. \\n\\nIm just wondering what happened to the time slot that I was originally allotted? What was the doctor going to fully examine my son for a well visit in six minutes? And from the 30 people waiting, it was obvious they were not as prompt with their patients as they expect you to be with them. \\n\\nI\\'ve heard dr plonk is a \"good doctor\". But to me a good doctor is not just the medical knowledge, but how they treat their patients and families. I was very courteous and got to the point where I was pretty much  begging them to let me stay only to be ridiculed by a nurse who was extremely unsympathetic. \\n\\nAs I was leaving I inquired if I would be charged for the visit and if I needed to do anything with my insurance only to be told they didn\\'t know. I also asked to be deleted from the system but they said once I am in the system I cannot be deleted. I have a hard time understanding how someone who\\'s not a patient there needs to leave all of their family\\'s personal information with a doctor who is not treating them. \\n\\nBottom line is I was extremely disappointed with their customer care, their lack of courtesy and professionalism, and their inability to treat someone like a human being. In the end, I am glad my children will not be under their care if this is how the staff treats their patients!',\n",

Whoever spun that deserves a kudos! The first bite was great! The pasta was al dente! It still had that resistance to the bite, but cooked thoroughly!

Nonetheless, it was a decent plate for Fettuccine!\\n\\nDessert: \\nMaple Crème Brûlée with Biscotti (3/5)\\nI wish the crème brûlée was warm and not cold.

It was still palatable. \\n\\nMy friend had the Chardonnay Steamed P.E.I.

I took a bite of her salmon, the skin was so crispy, the salmon was still moist! Nom nom nom! The dish was so purrdy! The purple from the blueberry reduction is balanced by the green from the herb oil. I actually preferred her salmon over my pasta.

Then the NY, Alice Cooper gang hooligan types came in-hahaha thus why I like the Pops more than the classical. I will go to classical shows too so really I am just kidding. However. I do love the pops so much more. I know, I know, I feel like \"Just Jack\" from Will and Grace. I love me my musical theater and showtunes, Gleek here.  \\n   Last year I even got to see my all time musical theater hero diva perform,  Patti Lupone. SIGH! Got to meet her after the show too. Thanks Phoenix Symphony for that photo op! (Life goal number two, check!) Advice, now if you could only get Mandy I would truly be in heaven. ( Life goal check number 3 perhaps?) \\n   However, I do went to point out they do have something for everyone with an eclectic yearly calendar of different musical genres. I do worry about cultural Arts programs and budget cuts in Az so hope people continue to support them in any fashion. I know it is not NY or London but it\\'s still good!  I also love it when I see the young set being introduced to the Symphony. We sat next to a delightful 13 year old young man last night. He was rocking out with us. ( Ok Dad listens to S/G in the car every day. But at least the boy didn\\'t  appear to be having his teeth pulled out by being there)  So to all of my fellow music lovers, check it out, support local Arts, and enjoy!\\n\\nOh an afterthought- The person who sings with Jim ( can\\'t remember his name) does the meanest, most awesome, best impression of Edith Bunker ever.

Our second driver was so tall (feel bad that I forgot their names) and he's so funny. He told us stories of Las Vegas on the way there. When we got there, he walked us to the door of the courthouse. That way we didn't get bother by these people who stand around outside the courthouse to try to sell you chapel packages. After that, he dropped us off at Monte Carlo.

Only two vacant tables available, one of course which was for me.\\n\\nWe were seated at a cozy table towards the back of the restaurant beside the white brick wall with a wonderful view of the 2 wood burning ovens and the chefs hard at work. The restaurant has an industrial look to it with the exposed vents and piping on the ceiling, glazed concrete floors, and pops of colour from the multi-coloured hanging wired lights and different coloured metal chairs.\\n\\nOur waitress for the evening comes over and highlights the specials for night and takes our drink orders.\\n\\nTwo Glasses of bubbly refreshing Prosecco arrives. Truly delicious and imported exclusively for Libretto, I had to pace myself to keep from chugging the glass down. As well I love how the water is served in chilled glass bottles so I don't to wait on a refill, I can top it up myself!\\n\\nAfter taking our food order, our waiter asks if we would like some bread. It's nice that they ask for those who are worried about filling up before the meal however turning down bread is never an option for me so I gladly accepted her invitation. Warm sliced bread returns with a mixture olive and balsamic.\\n\\nTo start\\n\\nSpicy Meatballs -Tomato sauce, bomba, grana padano & crostino\\nI love me some meatballs and Libretto knows how to do it exceptionally well. Juicy, tender meat, full of flavour sitting in a bed of that delicious tomato sauce with the slightest kick of heat to compliment it. I would have liked some more of the toasty bread to mop of the rest of the sauce however our waitress took notice in our enjoyment of the sauce and offered to bring us some more house bread which we kindly appreciated.\\n\\nArugula Salad - Pear, walnuts, piave cheese & sherry vinegar\\nVery fresh tasting, I enjoyed the mixture of flavours with the tartness from the vinegar dressing, sweetness from the pears, and the crunch from the salted toasted walnuts was the perfect balance of flavours & textures.\\n\\nPizza\\nMargherita D.O.P. - Tomato, basil, mozzarella\\nI can not resist a crust prepared in a wood burning oven. The char and blistering on the thin chewy crust is phenomenal on its own but then throw on some of there delicious homemade tomato sauce dotted with gooey fresh mozzarella and hints of fresh basil leaves you a yummy carb induced coma. \\n\\nDessert\\nChocolate-Amaretto Budino - Topped with fresh whipped cream and macerated strawberries\\nThe sweet cream and fresh strawberries were a pleasant surprise to the addition of my budino. The budino however was the perfect ending to a savory meal. Not overly sweet but the perfect combination of thick chocolatey goodness with hints amaretto coming through was deeply satisfying.\\n\\nOverall a spectacular Italian meal served up at Libretto with excellent service and fresh, hot, delicious dishes, not a flaw from start to finish. Definitely check it out but I'd suggest making reservations to ensure you get a table.\\n\\nFYI They don't serve tea here however our waitress kindly offered to bring me some hot water and lemon. However I opted for an Americano instead and I was not the least bit disappointed. It was exceptionally good, strong rich aromatic flavour, not the slightest taste of bitterness with a nice crema on top.\",\n",

There are multiple food options from Bojangles chicken to food trucks and your normal stadium fare. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars like I did Bristol and other speedway motor tracks, is the lack of police presence inside the track and the lack of overall security. There were multiple highly intoxicated people (and yes I drank while there but not to excess) and at one point one fan started threatening the entire section he was sitting in while a security woman just stood and watched for over 5 minutes and did nothing. Many of us tried to contact the speedway through text messages and a couple of us looked for police officers but neither panned out.

In fact, he called 15 minutes before pick-up to let me know he was still waiting on someone at another hotel and may be a few minutes late. I appreciated that. \\n\\nThe issue I had was that Pink Jeep schedules all the pick-up times at the same time resulting in delays. If the pick-ups were scheduled in a staggered fashion the final pick-up would not be delayed thus shrinking the amount of time permitted for the actual tour.\\n\\nI also think that the amount of time allotted for the tour was not enough because we rushed directly to the dam tour and made it out just in time to take a few pictures. We did not get to go to the exhibits or walk the top of the dam before we were required to meet back up. This issue could be resolved by not requiring the drivers to gather up each member of the group for a huddle prior to going on the dam tour. This took an extra 30 minutes that we could have already been down on the tour. I noticed that all the other Pink Jeep tours were doing the same thing so it appears to be a company policy. \\n\\nThe pink Jeep is really a pink Dodge but it is one heck of a truck. As a truck guy I read the little pamphlet in the vehicle about the engine, design, capabilities and thought \"Cool...I wonder how well it would do in the mud.\". Ok, so enough about the truck. The tour was fascinating. Bob drove us through old Boulder City explaining the history of the dam and Boulder city. He got us to the damn, brought us to a place to take pictures then back to the reception center where we were escorted to the secure area where our dam tour began. He gave us a time to meet him back at the meetup point and we were off. \\n\\nThe dam tour provided by the Bureau of Reclamation was very short and hurried but informative and interesting. We were then able to walk on the dam and observation deck taking as many dam pictures as we liked though with such a limited amount of time we were indeed limited. \\n\\nSoon after that we were whisked away back to our hotels. The whole experience was great and interesting. We were able to get some good pictures. I think Bob knew more about the dam than the Bureau folks. Would have liked a little more time but it was good none-the-less.\\n\\nGreat job Bob and Pink Jeep. We enjoyed our trip.',\n",

Open for a year now this place has now started making take-home food like sausages and other items. \\n\\nTheir space is a frequently used event space and show space and I could not recommend it enough of you are looking to set up a fundraiser, event or meet up. \\n\\nNicely spaced tables--you won't feel like you are sitting on your neighbours lap. No trouble for anyone with strollers or who may need an accessible space. \\n\\nA+ we like them a lot and we hope they stick around for a long time.\",\n",

I went last night for the first time in a long time and it was surprisingly quiet.  The building it is located in is great.  Lots of food to gorge on pre and post movie and right at Dundas station.  To get to the theatres you have to take what may come across as a labyrinth of escalators, but after a few visits it all makes sense.  Tickets are purchased at the ground level which is very odd if its your first time there.  The lineups can be long so I recommend the kiosks that are on the theatre level, which less people use.  The user interface of the kiosks is extremely painful.  It reminds me of a high school project I did in grade 10 computer class back in the 90s.  Also, half the kiosks are out of order most of the time.

I had mentioned very early on that I hadn\\'t had my nails done in a while... so when I mentioned I thought my nails were way too narrow and looked like they were missing parts of the nail he rudely said, \"your nail bed is wide and it looks better narrow and you even said yourself you haven\\'t had nails in a long time!\" When I showed him one area that was really bad he snapped at me and said, \"if you don\\'t like them I will wrap them up right now and take them off right now, I don\\'t need to waste my time!\"  I was shocked and felt like I was going to cry... my friend steps in and says, \"how about you just fix that nail?\"  So he finally agrees to add some more powder on... he makes the nail super thick compared to the others and quite frankly it looked only slightly better. I had to ask him if he could use the drill to make it less thick all over... which he did but it still is thicker. At this point I just wanted to be done and go home. Then as he was putting on the top coat I asked him why the color was all splotchy and not even and he says that that is the way the color looks and it\\'s \"marbled\" and if I don\\'t like it he can add glitter on top... I told him it was fine and just to leave it because at this point things were just awkward and I wanted to leave.

Traditionally, exercise rooms have mirrors.  It is unnatural to take classes in rooms without mirrors.  Mirrors are an absolute need and there are many reasons for that.   I don\\'t know of any health clubs that have training rooms without mirrors and I have been member of many gyms in the US and abroad.   To me, it\\'s unbelievable and it\\'s a shame that a club like LVAC removed the mirrors from the main exercise rooms.  To make it more incomprehensible, the only room that has mirrors is upstairs where they offer the cycling classes.  Now, does that make any sense?   I\\'m having a problem understanding the rationale behind it.   And to make things worse, they painted the room black!   It\\'s taking them forever to finish the so called \"renovation\" of the room.  As of this writing, Room 1 is ugly, depressive and lacks logistics.  They have added new features that people don\\'t care for and many members are very unhappy, others like me, have not gone back to the classes.   The gigantic LVAC sign in the center of the room is good for nothing.  Wrong allocation of money.  We were deprived of our regular classes in that room for weeks and now it\\'s mid-March and the room is not finished yet.  This is terrible and shameful.  They should fire the \"brilliant\" mind behind this failed project.  By the way, complaints to the management have been made to no avail.\\n\\nFor me the club now is crippled.  It no longer meets my needs.  That\\'s not the club I joined 3 years ago.  I bought a 3 year membership in a club that had mirrors in every training room.  At the time, that was not even an issue because that\\'s the norm.\\n  \\nAnyway, the above is MY opinion.  Some may not care about mirrors and good for you.  As for me, I refuse!',\n",

But, it is an enthusiastic 3, so you should definitely check it out.  \\n\\nI love museums and the \"tiger mom\" in me likes to expose my young kids to educational opportunities whenever I have the chance.  I\\'ve only ever been to big museums in big cities, so I knew not to come in with high expectations.  I moved from SoCal almost 3 years ago, and have always made the best of what sin city has to offer for the kids.  Admission is $10 for adults, $5 for children ages 3-11, and Parking is free.  *If you are a coupon seeker, their website does offer a FREE adult entry with another paying adult. I happened to visit during \"Ologist day\" kicking off the 2013 Las Vegas Science and Technology Festival- and it was free entry for all.  \\n\\nThis was a great treat for my 4 1/2 year old daughter.  There were about a dozen scientists with tables set up so that the kids can meet real scientists, ask questions, and view demonstrations.  There was a biologist, marine biologist, meteorologist, geologist,  and more! It was like being at a school science fair.  They had tables set up and a display board, and were very eager to share their experiences and expose the kids to different fields and get them excited about science. My kid loved it.  And so did I.  She now wants to be a Marine Biologist. \\n\\nThe museum may be small, but it does have a lot to offer in the small space.  There are exhibits of various stuffed wildlife, and even a stuffed black bear that you can actually touch! There is an exhibit of marine life and a tiny pool of manta rays and tiger sharks.  There are also tanks of various types of fish including a type of fish that have evolved without eyes because they live in underwater dark caves.  If you don\\'t use it, you lose it.  I found them so fascinating!  In addition, there are also dinosaurs, an African wildlife display, Ancient Egypt exhibit, and a room where the kids can have a hands-on learning experience.\\n\\nTo truly get the most out of the museums, check their website often or \"like\" their page on Facebook so that you can see the various presentations, events, and educational programs that they offer.  Vegas doesn\\'t have to be an \"adults only\" playground.  There are definitely plenty of activities for kids too- you just have to look for them.  Besides, kids aren\\'t too picky.

       "  'CHjmzfE0PhHhetuQLEEE6g': 'I was in LV for just a few days, so I really   wasn\\'t sure if I could get my hair permed straight for an upcoming work trip. I hadn\\'t done anything with my hair in two years and it was severely damaged, so I really needed to do something with it before meeting with my new co-workers. Well, I called Marshall Beauty Salon and they were able to fit me in on short notice. I chose Marshall because of the many positive reviews.\\n\\nNow, my hair is wavy in some parts, curly in others, yet pseudo-straight in other areas. In other words, it\\'s a mess. For me to get a straight perm, my only option was to get a Japanese straight perm where the hair wouldn\\'t get damaged like the regular perms cause. The problem is, Japanese straight perms are expensive. In Phoenix and Scottsdale, they run well over $300. Unless you make a decent salary or you save up for a Japanese straight perm, it\\'s not gonna happen. But getting a Japanese straight perm is affordable! Sure, $150 - $200 isn\\'t chump change, but considering what you\\'re getting, it\\'s a wonderful deal for those of us who can\\'t afford a $300 perm but absolutely need the Japanese perm to not damage our hair. In that sense, Marshall Beauty Salon is a God Send. Sadly, they\\'re in Las Vegas and I would have to drive 6 hours to get my Japanese straight perm next year (that\\'s how long this perm will last, so really, the price isn\\'t bad at all).\\n\\nThe place is run by Korean hair specialists, and the gentleman who did my hair doesn\\'t speak English fluently. The gal who helped him with my perm speaks English though, so that was very helpful.\\n\\nSince I only got a perm, I can\\'t really comment on the cutting and styling techniques. I only cut my hair shorter so that I could get the $150 perm for hair up to the shoulder. Any longer and you\\'ll have to pay $200. \\n\\nHere\\'s the thing. When I called, the person who answered the phone told me that the Japanese perm was $150 but that regular straight perm was $70. That was not the case when I got there. Yes, the Japanese straight perm starts at $150, but the $70 perm is not for straight perming. I didn\\'t have all that money on me, and even paying by card, I didn\\'t have enough in the bank to give the guy who did my perm enough tip (SORRY!!!). So next time I go, I will be tipping the guy more. \\n\\nThis is not a \"high-end\" salon by any means, but they did an awesome job with my Japanese straight perm which are usually only available in high-end salons. I\\'m just so thankful that they\\'ve made this special perm affordable for just about anyone. I don\\'t know what I\\'d do if they raised the price.... Please don\\'t raise the price! Haha',\n",

If a 4 year old who is usually never allowed sweets cannot finish off dessert, there is a problem.\\n\\nStill, the atmosphere is cute.

The carrots were absolutely delicious and the calamari was good too.  However, they apparently season the stuff with lemon and throw the lemons in the deep frier too!  On more than one occasion I mistakenly bit into a fried lemon, YUCK!  The Mac and Cheese was delicious, and a different but welcome spin on the classic.

We had mentioned Yelp and got the 10% off promotional discount. Normally it would have been $38 per person.\\n   \\nLocation: \\nIt was located in a strip mall. There was plenty of parking in front and was a decent area that was much less busy than the foot massage places in China Town.\\n\\nTime and Date:\\n4:45pm on a Monday. We were the only people there. We had no appointment.\\n\\nBlow by Blow experience:\\n    There is a black film over the windows so you cannot see through to the inside. No nonsense and no frills, but clean and serene.  It was dimly lit in the entrance, and there was no one at the front desk, however a woman named Elaine came from the back quickly and welcomed us with a genuine smile. She looked professional and does a lot of good for the typical stigma that asian massage parlours get. This is serious reflexology and that is it.\\n \\n     The first room is a larger and open, dimly lit room. Not dark and dingy but darkly soothing and peaceful. All of the chairs were substantially roomy. With ottoman. Each chair also could be reclined into a full face down massage table. We were led into a couple\\'s semi-private room. There was a half curtain instead of a door that one had to bow slightly to enter. There were hooks on the wall for hanging your personal belongings and a table between two massage chairs.\\n\\n     As we got comfortable, Elaine asked if we would care for a cup of tea which was served in a styrofoam cup. It was nicely brewed and a welcome start to the massage experience. Rex, her partner, came from the back and turned on the AC, dimmed down the lights even more as she left to run 2 steaming hot foot baths in wooden tubs lined with plastic. It looked very sanitary. Everything felt and looked clean. It was very easy to close my eyes and relax, just with these first steps. In the background musak played, which was fitting in a way, though I normally hate musak.\\n\\n     When the massage started we were asked to sit facing our chairs on the ottoman, resting our feet in a hot foot bath. a pillow and towel were placed on our laps and the experience started with what I call \"the warm up massage\". This helped me loosen up and relax. I could tell it worked because after a few minutes I began slumping forward over my lap pillow.\\n\\n     This portion of the massage entailed working the neck, shoulders, upper back, and upper arms. Both Rex and Elaine have what I call \"hard hands\". This is a welcome trait in a masseuse. This allowed them to apply as much pressure to points as one might like, and I was quite happy with the pressure they were using. They asked throughout the massage at key points if I wanted more or less pressure. I never has them change their default amount. If you\\'re a love of deep tissue massage and the no pain, no gain philosophy then you will love this style. I had never had reflexology before. Some purists of this style say it\\'s not really reflexology because lotion is involved. Apparently I don\\'t really care if it is or isn\\'t, lol, because in the end I was jelly and quite happy.\\n\\n     During this \"warm-up\" massage I was asked how long a massage I wanted. I asked for 60 minutes. I forgot to mention we were also asked if we wanted a man or woman attending us. The staff was incredibly quiet, which was wonderful. We knew there must have been a second team in back because we did hear quiet voices at one point. There were no phone calls during the massage service.\\n\\n     From the warm-up massage we were asked to sit back in the main reclining chair where we had our skull, faces, and base of the head/top of the neck attended to. Until you have had your head and face touched in this manner, you have no idea how many pressure points can be manipulated and how incredible you can feel only having such small areas worked on. It was curiously educational and fun as well as and most importantly relaxing, just to experience the strange patterns they might massage at certain points. I have never has western massages that were this interesting.\\n\\n     From the head and face, we had the full foot and leg massages. After that we were asked to flip over and we had the full body head, neck, shoulders, back, arms, upper and lower legs, even a good pressing on my buttocks(and not in a sleazy way.) It was wonderful. It becomes the sort of trust you give professionals when your health is in their hands. You find yourself handing over your body and mentally saying \"just fix me. I trust you.\" That\\'s a good thing to have happen and it definitely happens here.\\n\\nI am converted. I am in love. I will definitely go back.\\nThere is boba tea next door. Boba tea. Boba tea.
