# Black Box of Business
INF 553 Project

We live in a world where decision making of businesses is influenced by big data. Though businesses are able to get the                      value out of data to improve their business, with the volume, variety and quality of data rapidly changing along with the                     computing power on an increasing rate, there is always room to find more useful patterns. We would like to exploit this                     capability in mining the Yelp dataset and identify some interesting correlations/patterns related to customers, location and                relationship between customers and businesses that can have significant impact on the businesses. We propose to dig                 deeper to see what factors are affecting the businesses and how indicative they are in influencing the business.We would                    like to do the following: 

* Analyze if attributes of a business are playing a major role in customers choosing the business
* Analyze if images that have been posted along with reviews play a role in user's decision of visiting a particular business
* Analyze the extent to which user reviews are contributing to the growth of the business

#### Importance: 
 
By analyzing the attributes that affect the growth of a business, businesses can take advantage of the factors affecting                   them and benefit from that. On the contrary, businesses can also improve upon the factors that are contributing towards                   their failure. 

#### Data:
We make use of the Yelp Dataset (as a part of Yelp Dataset Challenge 2018) and Images to identify the attributes that affect the growth of the business. We mainly deal with the following datasets:
```
yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
yelp_academic_dataset_checkin.json
yelp_academic_dataset_photo.json
yelp_academic_dataset_review.json
yelp_academic_dataset_tip.json
```
